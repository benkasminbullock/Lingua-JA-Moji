=item L<Data::Validate::Japanese>

This contains four validators for kanji and kana, C<is_hiragana>,
corresponding to L</is_hiragana> in this module, and three more,
C<is_kanji>, C<is_katakana>, and C<is_h_katakana>, for half-width
katakana.

=item L<Lingua::JA::Kana>

This contains convertors for hiragana, half width and full width
katakana, and romaji. As of version 0.07 [Aug 06, 2012], the romaji
conversion is less complete than this module.

=item L<Lingua::JA::Romanize::Japanese>

Romanization of Japanese. The module also includes romanization of
kanji via the kakasi kanji to romaji convertor, and other functions.

=item L<Lingua::JA::Romaji::Valid>

Validate romanized Japanese. This module does something similar to
L</is_romaji>, L</is_romaji_strict>, and L</is_romaji_semistrict> in
Lingua::JA::Moji, but it has some extra options as well.

=item L<Lingua::JA::Hepburn::Passport>

Passport romanization, which means converting long vowels into
"OH". This corresponds to L</kana2romaji> in the current module using
the C<< passport => 1 >> option, for example

    $romaji = kana2romaji ("かとう", {style => 'hepburn', passport => 1});

=item L<Lingua::JA::Fold>

Full/half width conversion, collation of Japanese text, including
handling of line breaks.

=item L<Lingua::JA::Romaji>

Romaji to kana/kana to romaji conversion.

=item L<Lingua::JA::Regular::Unicode>

This includes hiragana to katakana, full width / half width, and wide
ascii conversion. The strange name is due to its being an extension of
L<Lingua::JA::Regular> using Unicode-encoded strings.

=item L<Lingua::JA::NormalizeText>

A huge collection of normalization functions for Japanese text. If
Lingua::JA::Moji does not have it, Lingua::JA::NormalizeText may do.

=item L<Lingua::KO::Munja>

This is similar to the present module for Korean.

=item L<Lingua::JA::Onbiki>

Convert a Japanese tilde character into the appropriate vowel. To
achieve this with Lingua::JA::Moji, see the following example:

[% example("onbiki") %]

=item L<Lingua::JA::Jtruncate>

Handle character boundaries over bytes in the old Japanese encodings
EUC, JIS, and Shift-JIS, for people who don't like converting to
Unicode.

Until about 2008, I used to use CP932 (Microsoft variant of Shift-JIS)
in Perl programs, until I had the bad experience of tracking down a
very strange bug caused by the "kanji space", U+3000, containing an @
mark when written in CP932, and being interpreted by Perl as an array.

=item chouon

The long vowel marker, "ー", or I<chōon>, which is used in Japanese
katakana to indicate a lengthened vowel. See L<What is the long line symbol used in katakana?|http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/chouon.html>

=item dakuten

=item handakuten

Dakuten, 濁点, literally "voicing mark", and handakuten, 半濁点,
literally "half voicing mark", are diacritic marks which appear on
some kana to convert them to a voiced consonant. In modern Japanese
encodings, these are usually displayed as part of the kana, but in
L</halfwidth katakana> they are displayed separately from the kana to
reduce the number of characters which need to be encoded. 

This module offers L</split_sound_marks> and L</join_sound_marks> to
associate or dissociate the marks from kana, which may be used, for
example, for the case of Morse code, Braille, or halfwidth kana
conversion.

=item halfwidth katakana

Halfwidth katakana, I<hankaku katakana> (半角かたかな) is a legacy
encoding of katakana based on an eight-bit encoding. See
L<What is half-width katakana?|http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/half-width-katakana.html>
for full details.

=item sokuon

Sokuon, 促音, is the use of a small kana tsu to indicate a doubled
consonant. This smaller letter was not used in some kinds of older
encoding such as Morse codes.

=item syllabic n

In this document, "syllabic n" means the kana ん or ン. See L<What is syllabic n?|http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/syllabic-n.html> for full details.

=item wide ASCII

Wide ASCII, fullwidth ASCII, or I<zenkaku eisūji> (全角英数字) are a
legacy of bitmapped fonts which has survived into the present
day. "Wide ascii" characters were originally special bitmapped font
characters created to be the same size as one kanji or kana
character. The name for normal ASCII characters in Japanese is
I<hankaku eisūji> (半角英数字), literally "half width English letters
and numerals". See L<What is "wide ASCII"?|http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/wide-ascii.html> for full details.

=item youon

Youon (拗音) means the use of kana ending in "i" with a small ya, yu,
or yo kana, such as しゃ (sha) or きょ (kyo). These are called
"glides" by linguists.

=head1 HISTORY

"Moji" (文字) means "letters" in Japanese. I started Lingua::JA::Moji
out of a need for more comprehensive handling of Japanese text than
was offered by any of the existing modules on CPAN. There were a lot
of modules offering piecemeal romaji/kana conversions or
hiragana/katakana conversions, but, with apologies, nothing truly
comprehensive or robust. Lingua::JA::Moji was originally a private
module. Most of the functions in the module are things I needed for my
own projects.

The design using L<Convert::Moji> was part of an abandoned plan to
make a cross-language module which could produce, say, a JavaScript
converter doing the same things as this Perl one, using the same text
sources.

I wasn't really sure whether to release it, but eventually I released
it to CPAN as a result of requests for the source code of an online
romaji/kana converter by website users. The module interface, in
particular the hash reference options to L</kana2romaji> and
L</romaji2kana>, is rather messy, and some of the defaults are rather
strange, but since it was described in Naoki Tomita's book, and some
people may be using it as is, I'm not very keen to change it in
incompatible ways.

=over

=item 0.24

This version added L</katakana2syllable>.

=item 0.27

This version added L</is_romaji_strict>.

=item 0.36

This version added the L</nigori_first> function.

=item 0.37

This version added L</is_romaji_semistrict>.

=item 0.43 

This version added support for
L<hentaigana|http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/hentaigana.html>. This is
based on copy and paste of the Unicode 10.0 standard draft
documents. See the directory L<F<data>|[% info.repo
%]/tree/master/data> in the github repository for the files used to
generate this data.

=item 0.46

This version disallowed hyphens as the first character of a romaji
string and added L</smallize_kana> and L</cleanup_kana>.

=item 0.47

This version added a list of the "Yūrei moji" (幽霊文字), false kanji, and
changed romanisation somewhat.

=item 0.48

This version changed L</kana2romaji> to be consistent with the
documentation for the long vowel options C<wapuro> and C<none>.

=item 0.53

This version added L</join_sound_marks> and L</split_sound_marks> to
the module.

=item 0.54

This version removed the nonsensical C<kana_order> function from the
module. It improved the behaviour of L</is_romaji_strict> after
comparing its negatives and positives with a large number of English
and nonsense words. It improved the behaviour of L</smallize_kana>
with regard to the "tsu" kana. L</cleanup_kana> was improved to deal
with stray dakuten and handakuten and some other odd kanji/kana
confusions.
