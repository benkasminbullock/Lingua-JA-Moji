If you want to contribute to this module, please file a github issue
about what you want to do before you start work.

The build process for Lingua::JA::Moji is quite convoluted, so unless
you only need to do a small change on a file, I don't recommend using
the fork and pull request system directly, because building this
module from the repository sources will be difficult.
